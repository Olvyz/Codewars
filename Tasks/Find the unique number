/*There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!
find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2

Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.
The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
This is the first kata in series:
Find the unique number (this kata)
Find the unique string
